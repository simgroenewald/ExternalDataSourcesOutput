Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 19

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● We will write a program that allows students to register for an exam
venue.
● First, ask the user how many students are registering.
● Create a for loop that runs for that amount of students
● Each loop asks for the student to enter their ID number.
● Write each of the ID numbers to a Text File called “RegForm.txt”
● This will be used as an attendance register that they will sign when they
arrive at the exam venue.

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called ‘Optional_task.py’
● Create a text file called ‘numbers1.txt’ that contains Integers which are
sorted from smallest to largest.
● Create another text file called ‘numbers2.txt’ which also contains Integers
that are sorted from smallest to largest.
● Write the numbers from both files to a third file called ‘allNumbers.txt’
● All the numbers in ‘allNumbers.txt’ should be sorted from smallest to
largest.
